# CO and ML Pipeline for TSP

This repository contains the complete pipeline for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) using Machine Learning (ML) and Combinatorial Optimization (CO).

## Getting Started

1. **Adjust Variables**:
   - Scroll to the bottom of the CO and ML pipeline files to adjust all necessary variables for your use case.
   - The current code should run as-is, but note that the relative paths for the datasets or output files might need to be updated after cloning or uploading the repository.

2. **Training and Test Data**:
   - `tsp_dataset_with_optimal8.json` contains the **training data** with 300 datapoints.
   - `tsp_dataset_with_optimal9.json` is the **unseen test data** used for evaluation.
   - Ensure the file paths are correctly configured in the pipeline.
   - Or alternatively use the tsp file to create your won dataset with an error

3. **Output Path**:
   - Configure the output path for saving results. You can do this at the end of both the ML and CO pipeline scripts.
   - Alternatively, pre-saved results from the first successful pipeline run are already accessible in this repository. If you prefer not to produce a new result and evaluate it, you can skip this step.

## Evaluation

1. **Using the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - A Jupyter Notebook is included for evaluation purposes.
   - You may need to adapt the relative paths for input files depending on your system configuration.
   - Other than adjusting file directories, the notebook runs without issues.

2. **Performance Notes**:
   - The evaluation of the PTO (ML pipeline) pipeline may take a long time to complete. If this happens:
     - Rerun the script. After a few tries, it should work as expected.

## Additional Information

- For detailed results and configurations, refer to the output files generated by the pipeline or use the pre-saved results.
- Feel free to explore and tweak the variables and hyperparameters to customize the pipeline for your specific needs.
